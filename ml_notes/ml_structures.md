## Single Layer Feed Forward

- Inputs are modified through an activation function to feed directly to output nodes
- f. ex. Perceptron
- `Delta rule`: calculate the difference between the expected and actual output and modify the weigths to minimize the difference
- `Gradient descent`
- Supervised learning
