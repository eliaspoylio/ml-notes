Types:
- 
- Supervised
- Unsupervised
- Reinforcment

All are trying to find patterns in data but each one has a different goal, uses different training methods and has different set of algorithms.

Supervised:
- 
- Feed inputs and expected outputs into model
- f. ex. perceptron
- linear regression, decision tree, K-nearest-neighbors

Supervised:
- 
- Raw data into the model
- No clear expected output
- No training
- Good at grouping and clustering data to find patterns
- f. ex clustering and data compression algorithms
- apriori, K-means

Reinforcement:
- 
- inputs and often a rewarding mechanism
- tries to maximize the goal or reward
- keeping track of state
- game AI
- f. ex. Markov decision process
