- Techincal
Statistics & algorithms to perform a task not programmed to.

- Practical
Finding patterns in data without us writing the algorithm to find the patterns.


Training: feed data into the model to increase performance over time without modifying the algorithm itself. If a machine produces better results after time with the same algorithm it has learned.

ML simplified: recognizing patterns

- prediction
    - assumption that history repeats itself
    - if x causes y and x happens again we expect to see y again
    - weather reports, stock market prediction (, Asimov's "Foundation"?)
- classification
    - grouping items into categories based on a predetermined set of features
    - spam/ham, image recognition
- customization
    - takes into account your previous habits and makes decisions based on that
    - Spotify, Youtube, targeted ads
- translation
    - input/output from different languages
    - different sentence structure, genders, conjugation
    - universal medium language
    - encoder/decoder structure
    - Googles AI created it's own medium language
    - compressed feature vector
- AI
    - deduction & reasoning
    - respond to what you are doing and what they have seen
    - computer can calculate scenarios much faster than humans. f.ex. chess, go
    - data from previous chess games
